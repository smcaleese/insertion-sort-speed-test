# insertion-sort-speed-test
<p>Two projects that show the time taken to sort ten-thousand random numbers in C++ and Python.</p>
<p>Running both projects shows that C++ is about forty times faster than python at insertion sort.</p>
<h2>Instructions for running the C++ project.</h2>
<p>The C++ project can be run in Code Blocks. To do this, open the insertion-sort-speed-test.cbp file in Code Blocks from the insertion-sort-speed-test-cpp folder.</p>
<h2>Instructions for running the Python project</h2>
<p>1. Go to the directory of the python project in your terminal.</p>
<p>2. Run the python project from your terminal using this command: (make sure python is installed on your terminal first) </p>
<p>3. <code>python insertion-sort-speed-test.py < ten-thousand-random-numbers.txt</code></p>
