Two projects that show the time taken to sort ten-thousand random numbers in C++ and Python.
Running both projects shows that C++ is about forty times faster than python at insertion sort.

## Instructions for running the C++ project in Code Blocks
1. Open the insertion-sort-speed-test-cpp.cbp file in Code Blocks from the insertion-sort-speed-test-cpp folder.

## Instructions for running the Python project
- Requirement: make sure python is installed on your terminal first.
1. Go to the directory of the python project in your terminal.
2. Go to the directory of the project in your terminal.
3. Run `python insertion-sort-speed-test.py < ten-thousand-random-numbers.txt`.
